Once your research plan is established, the Guide will create corresponding research protocols. A research protocol includes all of the steps needed to conduct the research activity. Protocols are specific to a single research activity, such as a contextual inquiry, a usability test, or a user interview.\n\n## Set expectations\n\nClearly describe how the research plan relates to both business and user outcomes. Your research plan should inform or validate your [Hills](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/hills). Rely on your Guide. Be explicit about what your team plans to learn or test. Always share your research plans and protocols across the larger team.
