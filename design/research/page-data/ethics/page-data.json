It’s your job to make participants aware of the research procedures and have them sign the appropriate forms to confirm their participation and consent.

As you remove these biases, the research becomes more credible and honest. Some examples of everyday biases include:\n\n- Environmental bias: “The setup of hospital room we are in is different than the hospital room where the nurse normally works.\"\n- Study bias: “Having an observer in the room may change the way a user performs these tasks.”\n- Personal bias: “I don’t like the color orange.”\n- Social bias: “Teenagers are bad drivers” or “All researchers are introverts.”\n\n## Report all insights and limitations\n\nYour team should never hide or mislead research findings. Share back all negative and positive reports to stakeholders. This can be uncomfortable, but it’s your duty to report the truth. Give credit to other teams and authors. Additionally, state limitations and assumptions made, so as not to misrepresent the research.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"49262108efc2deb54660c6898e45a8b5","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":83},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ethics & responsibilities"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Ethics & responsibilities\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nEnsure that you and your team perform research that meets ethical standards.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Clearly state objectives\n\nYour team will conduct research for a specific reason known to both the team and the participant.
