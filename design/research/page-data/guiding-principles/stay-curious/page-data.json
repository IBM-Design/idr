Did you have the desire to learn more? That feeling is curiosity, and like any other skill, it requires nurturing over time. When you think something should be explored, follow that impulse and see where it leads. Hunches can often lead you down new and rewarding paths.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n## Keep asking why\n\nAsk questions about the world around you. Be humble and honest about what you know and what you don’t know. Identify unanswered questions to explore rather than just problems to solve.

Go out, experience, and explore rather than simply reading about it. Observing is better than listening in most cases. Imagine trying to visualize a person’s daily routine based solely on a series of phone interviews versus spending the day with them.\n\nEnterprise systems are made of many working parts. Explore problems from multiple angles to view all possibilities. Go deep, but also zoom out and consider the entire ecosystem of users, environment, and needs.

When you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, be aware that you’re still coloring their world with your perspective. Aim to keep your view of the world as unbiased as possible.
