title: Stay curious
---

## Embrace the beginner’s mindset

Think back to last time you discovered something surprising or unexpected. Did you have the desire to learn more? That feeling is curiosity and like any other skill it requires nurturing over time. When you think something should be explored, follow it and see where it leads. Hunches can often lead you down new and rewarding paths. Curiosity is strengthened when you learn to trust your instincts about people’s behaviors.

## Keep asking why

Ask questions about the world around you. Be humble about what you know and what you don’t know. Seek out unanswered questions to explore rather than just problems to solve.

## Dig deeper

Itentionally shift your point of view and allow you to see opportuntities more clearly. Go out, experience, and explore rather than only reading about it. Observing surpasses listening in most cases. For example, imagine trying to visualize a person’s daily routine based solely on a series of phone interviews.

Enterprise systems are made of many working parts. Explore problems from multiple angles to view all possibilities. Go deep, but also zoom out and consider the entire ecosystem of users, environment, and needs. What is the end-to-end journey?

## Acknowledge bias

People are inherently prone to bias, whether personal, cultural, social, or other and your view of the world is shaped by your experiences. When you put yourself in someone else’s shoes, be aware that you’re still coloring their world with your perspective. Aim to keep your view of the world as unbiased as possible. Evaluate the research based on your users' perspective rather than your own.

## Where you come in

As a team and individual, practice curiosity to ensure it’s a team skill that’s strengthened over time.

#### The Explorer:

- Where does our experience fit within the larger user journey?
- What bias do I bring to my team?
- Where can I physically go to learn more?
- What questions and assumptions should we prioritize to answer?

#### The Guide:

- What hunches have I ignored?
- What patterns emerge from this data?
- What are the research implications?
- How can I strive for unbiased research?
