## Pro Tips

- A wrap-up call and follow-up survey are great opportunities to gather any final supporting quotes about the program or product experience. They will also help you identify ways to improve the Sponsor User program in the future.
- If you want to go above and beyond, consider mailing a hand-written thank you note signed by your team.

    terminate program involvement at any time via written notice. This will then
