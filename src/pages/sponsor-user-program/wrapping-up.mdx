## Pro-tips

1. A wrap-up call and follow-up survey are great opportunities to get participant quotes about the program or product experience, which may prove useful for future presentations. It also helps to identify what they enjoyed about participating in the Sponsor User program or ways to improve.
2. If you want to go above and beyond, consider mailing a hand-written thank you note signed by your team.

    As mentioned in another topic, they can terminate the agreement at any time
    via written notice. The agreement will terminate one month after this
    notice. If a participant decides they no longer wish to participate in a
    particular program, they can do so at any time without notice. In either
    case, update your tracking documents and notify your program manager, Kathy
    Sitar and/or Perry Fuller.
