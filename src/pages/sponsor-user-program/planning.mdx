### Planning your program

The first step is for your team to establish a solid research plan for your feedback program. Below is a checklist to get you started:

- Identify the research objectives + goals of the program. What needs to be tested and why?
- Determine your participant user groups. Which personas, segments, or requirements do people need to match? This will become a screener to direct you to the right participants.
- Identify the specific industries (if any) participants should represent.
- Set a goal for the number of clients you are looking to recruit and how many you need from each user group.
- Draft research questions.
- Choose your methods.
- Identify a rough time frame of when the program will start and end.
- Decide time expectations for client participants.
- Assign clear roles within the project team. Discuss and answer questions like, “Who will secure clients for the program? Confirm agreements are in place? Run the kick-off meetings? Run the actual design sessions? Conduct the analysis? Report findings?” ... and so on.
- Decide where and how you will track program activities before you start. A central storage location such as a Box folder that all teammates can access and use is a great place to start.

##### Pro-tips:

- Download a research template.
- When assigning roles, keep in mind the client contact should be skilled in communication, organization and interpersonal relationships.
- IBM Design recommends a total of 5-8 users from multiple clients. A good spread may be 3-5 clients and 2-3 users from each client. This number will vary, however, and should be tailored to the needs of your project and team.

### FAQs

##### When should a team create their research plan?

You should create the research plan as early as possible once a project has kicked off and the team has started drafting Hills. As your Hills are being formed, the plan will help you determine the personas and types of research you want to conduct with end users. Research plans should be revisited and updated as projects progress.
