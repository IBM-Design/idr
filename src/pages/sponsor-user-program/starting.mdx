## Starting your program

Now that your plan is complete, the team is aligned on goals, and roles have been determined, it’s time to start your program. Below is a checklist to get you started:

- Recruit Sponsor Users.
- Set expectations with potential Sponsor Users. Common activities may include IBM Design Thinking workshops, sneak peeks into our latest offerings, participatory design, surveys, usability testing, contextual inquiries and interviews. The time commitment can vary from 1-2 hours per quarter up to 5 hours per week. A good average is 60-90 min every couple of weeks. See frequently asked questions for more details.
- Have users sign an agreement. An agreement should be secured prior to any kick-off meetings or feedback sessions with users. It’s okay to brief them on the program and benefits, but users are required to sign an agreement before confidential information is shared.
- All agreements should be tracked so other teams can see who is actively participating in your program.
- Hold a kick-off meeting with each user to ensure everyone is on the same page about the goals, activities, and timeframe.

##### Pro-tips

- When recruiting Sponsor Users, provide clients program details and requirements to gauge their interest and availability. IBM Design created template presentations to help educate your team and pitch the program to a potential Sponsor User. You can download them in the “Learn more” box below.
- Ask Sales, Services and Business Partners if you can “listen-in” on their conversations with clients or join site visits.
- Keep a pipeline of Sponsor Users so you can collect a healthy mix of feedback for your offering.

### FAQs

##### How do I get Sponsor Users?

There are a variety of ways to recruit Sponsor Users, ranging from recruiting users through conferences or events to working with members of your greater product team. Most often, different members of your team may already have established relationships with clients. Communicating and building a relationship with these team members who have access to clients can help you recruit Sponsor Users.

##### What is Intercom and how do I use it to recruit?

Intercom is a messaging tool integrated with Bluemix that allows IBMers to connect directly with Bluemix clients. The filters in Intercom help you to target clients, and the mobile app and email notifications help you respond quickly to clients. You can learn more and apply for access here.

##### Whose responsibility is it to identify and sign up new Sponsor Users?

There is no ‘one size fits all’ answer, and should be agreed upon by your team. Some business units have Sponsor User program managers. Other teams rely heavily on their OMs or research leads. The most important thing is that your team identifies a person who has the bandwidth, access and can be held accountable.

##### What do I do when I want to sign up a new Sponsor User?

Prospective Sponsor Users are required to sign a Sponsor User Program Agreement – or work for a client who has already signed one – before research begins. The agreement covers all feedback activities except beta programs and downloading pre-GA code. Once you’ve identified a client to participate, you need to determine whether they are already covered by an existing feedback agreement. Kathy Sitar or Perry Fuller can help you with this. If a client is not already covered, a new agreement will be created and sent to you to share with the prospective sponsor user.

##### Is there anyone with whom we cannot engage?

While it is not often the case, there are a small number of clients/employees on our denied parties list (DPL) with whom we cannot engage. If your client signs a participation agreement electronically via the click-on method, then the system will run a check against the DPL automatically.

##### What if a client has questions about the agreement that I cannot answer? To whom should I refer them?

You can reach out to Kathy Sitar or Perry Fuller.

##### Who is considered a client prospect for the Sponsor User program?

IBM customers and non-customers, including Business Partners.

##### Who is covered by an agreement once signed?

Once the client signs the agreement, it covers any user participant employed by that client. You do not need individually signed agreements for each user participant.
