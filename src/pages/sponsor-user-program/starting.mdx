- Set expectations with potential Sponsor Users. Common activities may include Enterprise Design Thinking workshops, sneak peeks into our latest offerings, participatory design sessions, surveys, usability testing, contextual inquiries, and interviews. Time commitments can vary from 1-2 hours per quarter up to 5 hours per week. A good average is 60-90 min every couple of weeks. See frequently asked questions for more details.
- Have users opt in to the program. Their consent to participate should be formalized via a feedback agreement. It’s okay to brief them on the program and benefits, but users are required to sign an agreement before confidential information is shared.
- All agreements should be tracked so other teams can see who is actively participating in your program.
- Hold a kick-off meeting with each user to ensure everyone is on aligned about the goals, activities, and timeframe.
