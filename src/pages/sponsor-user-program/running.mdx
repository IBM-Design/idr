Now that your program has started, here is a checklist of things to keep in
mind:

</PageDescription>

<Row className="bullets">
<Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

- Set (and stick to) meeting agendas.
- Track your program’s activities + communications with users.
- Remember that central storage location? Time to use it.
- Sponsor Users may agree to a particular time commitment or cadence of meetings, but be flexible if schedules change.
- Encourage users to interact with the product or service during research activities. This helps ground it in reality.
- Hold Playbacks for Sponsor Users so they can see how the product has evolved based on their feedback. This will also help make them feel a part of the team.
- Share findings + recommendations to your team regularly via Playbacks.

## Pro-tips:

1. Always be professional, courteous, and trustworthy. Remember, Sponsor Users are often existing or potential clients.
2. Always be considerate of users’ time and convey your gratitude for their participation.
3. Personal Information (PI) should only be collected if relevant and necessary for your business purpose(s) and should only be made available to other project team members on a need to know basis. For more details on PI see the FAQs below.
4. For Germany, you need to obtain written consent from the participant when collecting, storing, or processing PI and provide them with the purpose for which it will be used or shared. Individuals need to be informed if their data will be stored outside of Europe (which we have a consent form in place to cover this). For more country specific information on the Data Privacy Guidelines for Germany please refer to the Data Privacy in Germany slide deck.
5. Don’t let so much time go by without communicating that Sponsor Users wonder if the program is still active.
6. Stay up-to-date on each client and their potential issues.
7. Don’t make promises about features or release dates.

## FAQs

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem
    className="bx--type-body-long-02"
    title="Is there a limit on how many programs a Sponsor User can participate in?"
  >
    While there is no limit to the number of programs, IBM Design
    recommends individuals should only participate in one program at a time. An
    individual’s participation should last for no longer than six months. After
    their participation ends, sponsor users should have a six-month ‘no contact’
    period before beginning a new program. These guidelines will help us avoid
    overburdening participants and diversify the opinions and clients
    represented in our programs.
