<Column colMd={7} colLg={7}>

- Set and stick to meeting agendas.
- Track your program’s activities and communications with users.
- Ensure that you use your team's central file storage location. Make sure the appropriate permissions are in place to safeguard data privacy.
- Sponsor Users may agree to a particular time commitment or cadence of meetings, but be flexible if schedules change.
- Encourage users to interact with the product or service during research activities. This helps ground it in reality.
- Hold Playbacks for Sponsor Users so they can see how the experience has evolved based on their feedback. This will also help make them feel a part of the team.
- Share findings and recommendations to your team regularly via Playbacks.

## Pro-tips:

- Always be professional, courteous, and trustworthy. Remember, Sponsor Users are often existing or potential clients.
- Always be considerate of users’ time and convey your gratitude for their participation.
- Personal Information (PI) should only be collected if relevant and necessary for your business purpose(s) and should only be made available to other project team members on a need to know basis. For more details on PI see the FAQs below.
- Don’t let too much time go by without communicating that Sponsor Users wonder if the program is still active.
- Stay up-to-date on each client and their potential issues.
- Don’t make promises about features or release dates.

    title="Is there a limit on how many programs a Sponsor User can participate in?"
  >
    While there is no limit to the number of programs, IBM's Design Program Office
    recommends individuals should only participate in one program at a time. An
    individual’s participation should last for no longer than six months. After
    their participation ends, sponsor users should have a six-month ‘no contact’
    period before beginning a new program. These guidelines will help us avoid
    overburdening participants and diversify the opinions and clients
    represented in our programs.
