Sponsor Users are an Enterprise Design Thinking Key. A Sponsor User Program formalizes and scales these relationships. IBMers and end users co-create design solutions through continuous and iterative research and design. The program is not a channel for feature requests. Instead, insights gathered from the users, along with other research activities, inform your team’s Hills, roadmap, and offering.

## Who are Sponsor Users?

Sponsor Users are ‘clients’ (customers, non-customers, business partners, end users or organizations) who provide domain expertise to your team. They help you design experiences for real target users rather than assumed needs.

## Ok, but do I have to call them “Sponsor Users”?

The short answer? No.

The most important aspect of IBM Design Thinking is a relentless focus on human-centered outcomes. Working with end users helps us do just that, and this act of co-creation matters more than terminology. If you want to call it a feedback program, customer advisory council or something else, feel free. Just remember: Stay focused on your users.
