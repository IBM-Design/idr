## Research plans and guides  

A research plan is a document owned by the entire team that specifies what research will be conducted and how the research will inform the team’s work. Limit a plan’s objectives to remove ambiguity and increase alignment. Research plans are not static, so remember to adjust as you learn.

### Creating your plan

To create your plan, define your learning objectives, hypotheses, and assumptions as a team. Once your research plan is established, the Guide can inform and create corresponding research protocols. A research protocol differs from the research plan and is owned by the research team. Protocols are specific to a single research activity, such as a contextual inquiry, usability test, or user interview.

### Set expectations

Clearly describe how the research plan relates to both business and user outcomes. Your research plan should align to your Hills. Rely on your Guide. Be explicit about what your team plans to learn or test.

This includes explaining in your research plan:

- learning objectives
- how you will screen participants
- methodologies and techniques for data collection, synthesis, and analysis
- budget for conducting the research
- proposed metrics for determining success
- deliverables

Always share and communicate plans and protocols across the larger team to conduct fast and useful research that drives action.

### Practice reflection

Learn from others with design research expertise by offering your plans and deliverables to others for review. This reflection process allows you to critique the quality of your methodology choices, research insights, and planning process. Here are a couple ideas for how to hold a critique:

Gather design researchers for a group critique session. Choose one person to playback their research plan, insights, and documentation. Let the larger group ask questions and provide feedback. For a more casual approach, pair up with another research Guide to share your work and debate your choices and learnings.

During a design research critique, consider asking these questions:

- What were the original research objectives?
- Did the team discuss how this research integrates with previously conducted research?
- How strong is the analysis?
- What from the research was most memorable?
- What were the strengths and weaknesses of the research Playback?

### Assess, revise, and plan next steps

At the end of a research activity, compare your insights against your original objectives. How well do they align? How have you reduced your teams questions and assumptions about your experience? Are the implication and path forward clear?

The challenge of conducting research in the enterprise setting is speed. You don’t have the luxury of months of ethnographic research. Aim to be nimble. Ask yourself as a team, “What can we build today? What can we do to advance our team’s understanding?”

## Where you come in

Reflect together on what you’d like to learn.

#### The Explorer:

- What can we build to test this assumption?
- How can I contribute to the research plan?
- What might I learn from this research?

#### The Guide:

- What hypotheses is the experience built on?
- How well did we answer the objectives?
- How fast is the team continually learning?
- How does our experience measure up against the competition?
