## Get in the loop

An assumption is a clear articulation of something you think might true but needs to be proved or disproved with evidence. Identifying and addressing assumptions is key to mitigating risk in the areas we have the least clarity. Start with what you know and what you do not know. The art of writing a well-crafted assumption takes time and thought. It can be easy to get bogged down in the “what-ifs” or “need to know everything” feeling, otherwise known as research paralysis. If that happens, try prioritizing your questions and assumptions based on potential risk to your work.

Address and evaluate your assumptions and questions

One approach to validate your assumptions is to turn your larger research questions into testable statements. For example, a broad research objective might be, “How long do users spend looking for content?” Next time you’re doing a research activity, flip that question into a statement like this: Users need a more contextual way to find answers to complete everyday tasks. Then, collect evidence that proves or disproves that statement.

As you run experiments, make sure to identify factors that may influence your assumption. Specify what you are testing or seeking to understand. If you’re curious about how people use their tablets at home, consider what could affect or alter the data you examine, such as room of the house, time of day, age, etc.

If you cannot test your assumption, rewrite it until you can make a feasible research protocol. Remember that an assumption needs to be proven true or untrue with evidence.

## Collect quality data

Data collections describe the gathering, measurement, and control of information within a research activity.

Raw data exists in many mediums: sticky notes, photographs, recordings, objects, survey answers, academic articles, customer complaints, error logs, analytics, and more. It’s up to you to choose the appropriate data collection method for your research activity.

Keep in mind this adage: garbage in, garbage out. Gather data that reflects honest behaviors and reactions. Remember that the collection techniques used can influence how users respond. For instance, asking users to answer difficult questions over the phone, face to face, or in a survey can elicit different answers. Choose an appropriate method to collect your data. Don’t ask leading questions.

Ensure the data is reliable and valid. Make an effort to collect replicable and consistent data that encompasses a broad range of real user experiences. But don’t ignore the outliers. While you cannot design for all extreme characteristics, your team can understand the entire spectrum of needs. With the outliers, you may find neglected niches full of serendipitous opportunities.

Clean your data, and reduce human error before using. For quantitative data, this can mean ensuring data consistency or removing inaccuracies from your data sets. You can clean qualitative data by screening participants before inviting them to a study or removing that participant’s data from the collection before it’s synthesized.

## Organize your data through synthesis

Data synthesis involves the organization, categorization, and description of a body of data. Once you clean data, try organizing it a few different ways to clarify information. Combine the data by clumping, sorting, and taking tallies.

Sometimes the right synthesis method can depend on the context and collection method used. For example, if you collected data through a series phone interviews, you may choose affinity diagramming or coding to help you visually map the information in new ways. However, if you collected data through a quantitative method, then a descriptive summary can be beneficial.

## Seek patterns through data analysis

Data analysis seeks to uncover patterns, motifs, and inferences from synthesized data.

After you organize your data, interpret it in a meaningful way that’s based on evidence. Explain the data by looking for patterns. Make sure that you address the root cause, not symptoms. Find the factors that contribute to the main problem. Sometimes it can be helpful to look for contradictions in your data and explore why they might occur.

There are a variety of tools and resources to help analyze data. One popular method for analyzing qualitative user data is an experience map. If your data is more quantitative, you may choose the approach of an exploratory data analysis or inferential statistics.

Analyzed data needs to be transformed to focus the team journey towards a user outcome. It should breed quality insights your team can use today.

## Create powerful research insights

Research insights come from your analyzed data. They should be original, non-obvious, and actionable. They often explain the “how” or “why” rather than the “what” or “when” and might reveal people's true motivations—not just their actions.

You will likely craft many insights as a result of your analyzed data. Prioritize the findings based on impact, and rank them to influence team decisions appropriately. Choose those insights that require the least expense but result in high impact. A team is limited in what it can deliver depending on bandwidth, skills, and resources and your prioritization might shift as understanding increases.
